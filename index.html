    <p>This is Me !!! Hello everyone and anyone reading this, My name is Dakota Riely Alexander Rodgers and I was born and raised in Peterborough, Ontario. There were a few stops on the way to where I am now but im sure somehow someway we will get into that at a later date.</p>

    <p>My hobbies are this bootcamp, playing videos games with my friends, working as bad as that sounds, and going outdoors either on hikes or mountain biking with my best friend. I both enjoy being indoors on my computer and being outside enjoying nature which sometimes can kind of battle eachother for time.</p>

    <p>I have high hopes for this class and so far I have been enjoying it a lot. Even though sometimes I don't understand or it may seem hard there are experienced members of my class and the staff that are always there to help. Also nothings fun if it's super easy to do so I always love a challenge and seeing how things turn out after I put hard work into them.</p>
